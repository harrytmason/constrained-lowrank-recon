This folder contains an example application for the paper
	Subspace-constrained approaches to low-rank fMRI acceleration
	by Harry T. Mason, Karla L. Miller, Nadine N. Graedel, and Mark Chiew

Please download the data from ORA, and place in the folder 'Datasets' (or edit the appropriate lines in 'load_prior_n_data.m' by doing ctrl-f for 'Datsets/' and changing ot to the appropriate folder string

The example is found in testCLR (Constrained Low-Rank), and should be able to run without needing any set-up
	The purpose of this function is to allow the user to follow the mathematics, and is not intended to represent an optimised reconstruction.
The optimisation loops are in CLRoptm.m
The spatial subproblem is solved in CLRxsub.m
The temporal subproblem is solved in CLRtsub.m
The overall cost function is in CLRcost.m

CLRgenE.m generates the NUFFT structure, and uses M. Chiew's optim/transforms and J. Fessler's IRT toolbox https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/irt/
The subspacea.m function comes from Andrew Knyazev, Rico Argentati, and is accessed through the custom cssa.m function
While not used here, the Colormaps folder contains a set of perpetually uniform colormaps, and is included to allow easy visualisation if required to all readers.

The Colormaps, MC_utils, and irt folders will all need to be decompressed before use.
