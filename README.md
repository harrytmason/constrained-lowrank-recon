# constrained-lowrank-recon
Code related to a specific paper, which will be linked to if the paper is accepted.

The test code folder contains the wrapped up code that has been edited slightly for easy execution and understanding.

Please download the associated datasets at https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:78743195-4217-4e83-a749-d74941b3b2ac and place them in a folder called "Datasets" within the main folder.

A simple_english_explanation file contains an explanation of the paper which attempts to use as few scientific words as possible. Please message me if my attempt to simplify the science has caused it to be inaccurate and I'll edit it posthaste.
